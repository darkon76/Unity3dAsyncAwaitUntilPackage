# Unity3dAsyncAwaitUntilPackage
Add better support for await

Based of https://github.com/svermeulen/Unity3dAsyncAwaitUtil


### Installation
Reanimator can be [installed as a unity package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) 
using this url:
```
https://github.com/darkon76/Unity3dAsyncAwaitUtilPackage.git
```
I'm still not sure if and when it will land on the Asset Store.
